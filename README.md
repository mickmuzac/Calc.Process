Calc.Process
============

A very simple to use mathematical integrator made to test the laws of mathematics. I do plan on adding visualization and expanded functionality to it over time.

*It won't work properly until the next commit.* A few bugs will be fixed, including a generic function bug. Updates to the InputParser class (to support generic functions) will also be included.
