#Calc.Process

##Intro

A very simple to use basic calculus calculator made to test the laws of mathematics. I do plan on adding visualization and expanded functionality to it over time.

A few bugs will be fixed, including a generic function bug. Updates to the InputParser class (to support generic functions) will also be included.

*Unlimited generic functions. Supports any function in System.Math that accepts and returns a single double value.
*Unlimited terms in any given function.
*Multithreaded support for superior performance.
*Calculates both the definite integral value and derivative value at any given x.
*More features coming soon!

##Features

Because Calc.Process is in its very early stages, its feature set is currently limited. It can integrate basic polynomials of any length (time taken depends on your processor's speed). It can also find the derivative of those polynomials. Generic function support is currently in progress and should be added very soon.

##Change Log
6/13/2012 Added multithreading support resulting in a speed up of about 4-5x on average. Works very well with small dx or large function values.
